# mercedes-star-3d

<br>

This animation was created with **THREE.js**. It's made out of three cylinders (with different base radius) and a torus to form a **Mercedes Star**. I've used directional lights to cast a shadow onto the "infinite" plane below the star. 
I've used **MeshPhysicalMaterial** for the dark *chrome* look.

You'll find the source code for the **3d-Mercedes Star** in the **star.js** file.
